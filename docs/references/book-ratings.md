# Book Ratings

This section explains how KapitelShelf stores and displays user ratings for books and series.

## Overview

- **Book rating**: a per-user value attached to a book (stored in the active user's profile).
- **Series rating**: a calculated value from all book ratings inside a series for all users.

Series cards in the Library show the calculated series rating (average of user ratings for books in the series). The card displays the average value so you can quickly gauge popularity at a glance.
